AngularJS-Learning
==================

A bunch of links to blog posts, articles, videos, etc for learning AngularJS. This list is in its early stages. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have some links/resources to add. Also, I try to verify that the articles below have some real content (i.e. aren't 2 paragraph blog posts with little information) to ensure I'm not listing "fluff" pieces.
